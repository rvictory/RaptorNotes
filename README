This is a quick project I'm throwing together to explore some of the enhanced HTML5 tags for mobile (like being able to add pictures, etc.). I want something to be able to take notes in, and I want to take advantage of offline caching, etc.

Because of the nature of the project, I'm going to use a filesystem based storage and a single user authentication. This isn't supposed to be robust or huge, it's a personal project.
